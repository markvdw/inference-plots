# Inference Plots
Mark van der Wilk

A collection of plots that illustrate interesting properties of methods. Some are incorporated into
papers, others in teaching materials, and other are simply left here for curiosity.

You may use plots in e.g. teaching materials under the condition that an attribution and a link
to this repository is added.

### Setup
You may need to run `setup_datasets()` in `./tools/datasets/download_and_setup.py` on the first
run.
